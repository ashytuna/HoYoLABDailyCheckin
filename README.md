# HoYoLAB Daily Check-in

A minimal Chrome extension automatically check-in to HoYoLAB to claim rewards for Honkai Impact 3rd, Genshin Impact, and Honkai: Star Rail.

**Update:** Since miHoYo may add a CAPTCHA to the check-in process, this extension will **not** work on the days when CAPTCHA is required. From my experience, if you don't log in and out of your account regularly, the attendance system won't ask for a CAPTCHA completion.

## Requirements

This extension only works on Chromium-based browsers.

## How to Use

1. **Sign in to [HoYoLAB](https://www.hoyolab.com/)** if you haven't done so on this browser within a year.
2. **Clone** this repository, or download ZIP and then extract it.
3. On your browser, go to **Manage extensions**; or more simply, go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable **Developer Mode**.
5. Choose **Load unpacked**, and then choose the folder you got after step 2.

All steps above are one-time processes. After that, you need to start your browser at least once per day (UTC+8) to claim HoYoLAB Daily Check-in rewards.

This extension is loaded unpacked, so it will **not** be synced to your Google account. That means if you want to use this extension on another PC, you'll need to do each step manually again. In addition, you need to stay signed in to HoYoLAB by signing in at least once per year.
